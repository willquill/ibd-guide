# IBD Guide - Welcome

Hi! You are probably here because you or a loved one is suffering. I'm sorry. This website exists to provide a searchable database of links to information to everything you could possibly want to know about IBD or inflammatory bowel disease.

It's designed to be easy to navigate so you can quickly get to the information you seek. Over time, we'd like to add a wealth of links to each sub-page so you can essentially use this site as your own personal search engine.

See the sidebar to see what's covered. The goal is to cover everything, but this site is pretty new, so please be patient!
