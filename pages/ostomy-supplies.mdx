# Ostomy Supplies

**Ostomy pouching systems**: These are the main component of an ostomy care routine. They consist of a skin barrier (also called a wafer or baseplate) that adheres to the skin around the stoma, and a pouch that collects the stoma output. Different types of pouching systems include one-piece, two-piece, and drainable pouches.

**Ostomy accessories**: These are additional products that help manage an ostomy and maintain healthy skin. Common ostomy accessories include:

- Skin barrier wipes, pastes, and powders to protect the skin around the stoma
- Barrier rings or seals to fill in gaps and create a better seal
- Adhesive removers to gently remove the skin barrier
- Ostomy belts to provide additional support and security
- Deodorizers to minimize odor

Other supplies: Other useful ostomy supplies include stoma measuring guides, scissors to trim the skin barrier, and disposal bags for used pouches.

Overall, having the right ostomy supplies is crucial for maintaining comfort, preventing skin irritation, and managing output effectively for people living with an ostomy. The specific products used can vary based on the type of ostomy, individual needs, and personal preferences.
