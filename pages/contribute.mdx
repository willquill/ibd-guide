# How to Help

If you want to help improve the site, you can do it from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/willquill/ibd-guide). This entire website is created from the code in that link. But don't worry - you don't have to be a coder!

If you're not a coder, click [here](https://github.com/willquill/ibd-guide/issues/new/choose) to create a new issue. Just put in a title and description of what needs to be done, and we'll get an email so we can make the change.

If you have done your own stuff on GitHub before and know your way around, then you can submit a pull request with the change to the site. This allows you to directly change the site code and submit your change for approval. This is the preferred method for contributing because it means we don't have to code the change for you! ðŸ˜‹

Please report dead links via GitHub issues!
