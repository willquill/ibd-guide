Key dietary recommendations for individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):

- Eat a balanced diet with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat or non-fat dairy products. This provides a range of essential nutrients.
- Increase calorie and protein intake during IBD flare-ups to support healing and recovery.
- Consider a Mediterranean diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. This diet has anti-inflammatory properties that may benefit IBD.
- Try a semi-vegetarian diet that includes eggs, yogurt, legumes, brown rice, and pickled vegetables. This diet can be gentle on the digestive system.
- Limit intake of high-fiber foods such as seeds, nuts, beans, fruit, and bran during flare-ups, as they may be difficult to digest.
- Consider a low FODMAP diet, which restricts certain carbohydrates that can exacerbate digestive symptoms in some individuals with IBD.
- Stay hydrated by drinking 8-10 glasses of water per day.
- Choose lean proteins like meats, fish, eggs, poultry, and soy.

The specific dietary recommendations may vary depending on the individual's symptoms and disease state. It's best to work closely with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to develop a personalized IBD diet plan.
