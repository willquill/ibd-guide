# Treatment

The primary treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) include:

[**Anti-inflammatory drugs**](/treatment/drugs/anti-inflammatories): These are often the first step in IBD treatment and include 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) medications like balsalazide, mesalamine, olsalazine, and sulfasalazine.

**Corticosteroids**: Drugs like prednisone are used to manage IBD flare-ups and keep the immune system in check.

**Immunomodulators**: These medications, such as azathioprine and methotrexate, calm an overactive immune system.

[**Biologic agents**](/treatment/drugs/biologics): These include anti-TNF agents (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab) and anti-integrin medications (e.g., vedolizumab, natalizumab) that target specific parts of the immune system.

**Antibiotics**: Certain antibiotics like clarithromycin, rifabutin, and clofazimine can be helpful for mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease and treating complications like abscesses and fistulas.

**Surgery**: In some cases, surgical procedures like colectomy (removal of the colon) may be necessary to treat severe or complicated IBD.

The specific treatment plan depends on the type and severity of IBD, as well as the patient's response to different therapies.
