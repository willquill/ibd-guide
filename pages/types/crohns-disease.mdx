# Crohn's Disease

Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes chronic inflammation and irritation in the digestive tract.

The most common symptoms of Crohn's disease include:

- Diarrhea
- Abdominal pain and cramping
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
- Malnutrition

Crohn's disease can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus, but it most commonly occurs in the end of the small intestine (the ileum) and the beginning of the colon.

The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors that trigger an abnormal immune response, leading to chronic inflammation.

Crohn's disease is a lifelong condition that tends to involve periods of flare-ups followed by remission. Treatment aims to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, and prevent complications.
