# Ulcerative Colitis

Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and ulcers in the lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum.

The key features of ulcerative colitis include:

**Inflammation and ulceration**: The inner lining of the colon and rectum becomes inflamed and develops ulcers.

**Symptom flare-ups and periods of remission**: People with ulcerative colitis experience periods of symptom flare-ups followed by periods without symptoms.

**Varied symptoms**: Common symptoms include diarrhea, passing blood with stool, and abdominal pain. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.

**Chronic condition**: Ulcerative colitis is a long-term, chronic condition that typically requires ongoing management and treatment.

In severe cases, ulcerative colitis can affect the entire colon and cause more serious symptoms like heavy diarrhea, severe pain, bleeding, and fever.

Overall, ulcerative colitis is a complex inflammatory disorder that requires careful medical management to control symptoms and prevent complications.
