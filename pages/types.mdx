# Types of IBD

The main types of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are:

- **Crohn's Disease**: This condition involves inflammation and swelling in the digestive tract, which can affect any part from the mouth to the anus. The inflammation often occurs in patches, with healthy sections of the digestive tract in between affected areas.

- **Ulcerative Colitis**: This type of IBD involves inflammation and sores (ulcers) along the lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. The inflammation is typically continuous, without healthy sections in between.

In addition to these two main types, there are also less common forms of IBD, such as IBD Unclassified, where the condition does not fit neatly into Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

The key differences between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the location and pattern of inflammation in the digestive tract. Crohn's can affect any part, while ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon and rectum, and the inflammation is continuous in ulcerative colitis but patchy in Crohn's.
