# Anti-Inflammatories

Anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used as the first-line treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases.

The main types of anti-inflammatory drugs used for IBDs include:

**Corticosteroids**: These drugs suppress the immune system and are used to treat moderate to severely active IBD. They work in a non-specific manner to reduce inflammation.

**5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs)**: These anti-inflammatory drugs, such as balsalazide, mesalamine, and sulfasalazine, are often the first step in the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.

These anti-inflammatory medications help reduce the inflammation and symptoms associated with IBDs. They are typically the initial treatment approach before considering other medications like immunosuppressants.

It's important to note that while anti-inflammatory drugs can be effective, they can also have side effects, especially with prolonged use. Patients with IBD should work closely with their healthcare providers to determine the appropriate treatment plan.
