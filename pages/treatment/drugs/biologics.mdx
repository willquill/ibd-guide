# Biologics

Biologics are a class of medications that specifically target and block certain components of the immune system that drive inflammation in IBD. The most widely used biologics for IBD treatment are anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) agents such as infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab. These biologics work by blocking the action of TNF-α, a key inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of IBD.

Biologics are typically used to treat moderate to severe cases of IBD when other conventional treatments like immunosuppressants have not been effective. They can help induce and maintain remission, improve symptoms, and prevent disease progression and complications in IBD patients.

The use of biologics in IBD has expanded significantly in recent years as they have proven to be highly effective in managing the inflammatory aspects of the disease. Biologics are usually administered by injection or intravenous infusion, and require close monitoring by healthcare providers due to potential side effects.

## Commonly Used Biologics

**Adalimumab (Humira, Cyltezo, Amjevita)**: These are anti-TNF-α biologics that may ease symptoms of moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

**Infliximab (Remicade, Avsola, Inflectra, Ixifi, Renflexis, Zymfentra)**: These are also anti-TNF-α biologics used to treat both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

**Vedolizumab (Entyvio)**: This is a gut-selective integrin antagonist biologic used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

**Ustekinumab (Stelara)**: This is an interleukin-12/23 inhibitor biologic used to treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

The key differences between these biologics are the specific mechanisms of action and the specific inflammatory pathways they target to reduce inflammation in the digestive tract.
