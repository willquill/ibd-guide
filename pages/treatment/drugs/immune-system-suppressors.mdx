# Immune System Suppressors

Immune system suppressors, also known as immunosuppressants or immunomodulators, are commonly used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These medications work by suppressing or modulating the overactive immune response that drives the inflammation in IBD.

Some of the commonly used immune system suppressors for IBD include:

**Thiopurines**: Azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) and mercaptopurine (Purinethol, Purixan) are thiopurine medications that can help maintain remission and reduce the need for steroids in IBD.

**Methotrexate**: This immunomodulator can be used to treat moderate to severe IBD, particularly in patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate thiopurines.

**Cyclosporine**: This calcineurin inhibitor is sometimes used to treat severe, acute flare-ups of ulcerative colitis when other treatments have failed.

**Tacrolimus**: Similar to cyclosporine, tacrolimus (Prograf) is more commonly used for Crohn's disease, but may also be used to treat severe ulcerative colitis as a short-term bridge therapy.

These immunosuppressant medications are typically used when treatment with less potent drugs like aminosalicylates (e.g., 5-ASA) and corticosteroids has failed to control the inflammation. They can help induce and maintain remission, but require close monitoring due to their potential side effects.

In summary, immune system suppressors play a crucial role in the management of IBD by modulating the overactive immune response that drives the chronic inflammation associated with these conditions.
