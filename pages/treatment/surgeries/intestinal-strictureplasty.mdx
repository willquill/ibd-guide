# Intestinal Strictureplasty

Intestinal strictureplasty is a surgical procedure used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease.

In IBD, chronic inflammation can lead to the formation of scar tissue, which can cause narrowing or strictures in the intestines. Strictureplasty is performed to widen these narrowed sections of the intestine without removing any part of the bowel.

The procedure involves making an incision in the narrowed segment of the intestine and then suturing it in a way that widens the lumen, or inner diameter, of the bowel. This helps to relieve the obstruction caused by the stricture and allows for better passage of intestinal contents.

Strictureplasty is considered a safe and effective alternative to more invasive surgeries, such as bowel resection, as it preserves the length of the intestine and avoids the potential metabolic complications associated with short-gut syndrome.

Overall, strictureplasty is a valuable surgical option for managing complex Crohn's disease and intestinal strictures, allowing for symptom relief and improved quality of life for patients.
