# Colostomy

A colostomy surgery creates an opening called a stoma on the abdomen, through which the large intestine (colon) is brought out. This allows stool to pass through the stoma and into an external bag or pouch, rather than through the anus.

Colostomies can be temporary or permanent, depending on the patient's condition and treatment plan, and they are sometimes used when the entire colon needs to be removed (proctocolectomy) in severe cases of ulcerative colitis.

In IBD, ileostomies (where the small intestine is brought out as the stoma) are more common than colostomies.

In summary, a colostomy surgery is an option for managing severe cases of IBD by diverting stool away from the damaged intestine through a surgically created stoma on the abdomen.
