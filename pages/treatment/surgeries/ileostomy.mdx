# Ileostomy

An ileostomy is a surgical procedure performed to treat severe cases of IBD, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, when medications and other treatments are no longer effective. In an ileostomy, the surgeon creates an opening (stoma) in the abdomen and attaches the end of the small intestine (ileum) to it. This allows waste to be diverted from the colon and exit the body through the stoma into a pouching system.

There are a few different types of ileostomies:

**End ileostomy**: The entire colon and rectum are removed, and the end of the small intestine is brought out through the abdominal wall as the stoma.

**Loop ileostomy**: A temporary ileostomy where a loop of the small intestine is brought outthrough the abdominal wall, creating two openings - one for waste output and one for theremaining intestine This is often done as a first stage before permanent surgical options.

**Continent ileostomy (Kock pouch)**: A surgically created internal pouch made from a portion of the small intestine, which allows the person to self-catheterize and empty the pouch, ratherthan using an external pouching system.

The specific type of ileostomy recommended depends on the individual's condition, the extent of bowel involvement, and the surgeon's preference.
