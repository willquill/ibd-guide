# Ileoanal Anastomosis (J-pouch)

Ileoanal anastomosis, also known as J-pouch surgery, is a procedure used to treat severe cases of ulcerative colitis and other IBDs. In this surgery, the surgeon removes the entire colon and rectum, and then constructs a new "rectum" using the end of the small intestine (ileum).

Specifically, the surgeon creates a J-shaped pouch from the ileum, which serves as a reservoir to store and allow for controlled release of waste. This pouch is then connected directly to the anus, allowing the patient to pass stool normally without the need for a permanent ostomy bag.

This procedure, called a restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), is considered the treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis requiring surgery. It allows the patient to avoid a permanent ileostomy and maintain more normal bowel function.

Overall, the J-pouch surgery aims to remove the diseased colon and rectum while restoring the patient's ability to have relatively normal bowel movements, improving their quality of life compared to a permanent ostomy.
