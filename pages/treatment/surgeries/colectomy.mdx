# Colectomy

A colectomy is a surgical procedure to remove all or part of the colon (large intestine) that has been damaged by Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, which are the two main types of IBD. The goal of a colectomy is to remove the diseased portion of the colon and potentially provide a cure or relief from the symptoms of IBD.

The different types of colectomies include:

**Colectomy with ileostomy**: The entire colon is removed, but the rectum is left intact. A stoma (opening) is created on the abdomen, and an external bag is fitted to collect waste.

**Right hemicolectomy**: Only the right, or ascending, part of the colon is removed. The surgeon may also remove the appendix and other affected areas.

**Proctocolectomy**: This procedure removes the entire colon, rectum, and anus. An ileostomy is then created to allow waste to exit the body into an ostomy bag. This is considered a "curative" surgery for ulcerative colitis.

**Colectomy**: The entire colon is removed, but the rectum is left intact. This may be recommended if the colon is severely diseased but the rectum is unaffected by Crohn's disease.

The specific type of colectomy recommended will depend on the severity and location of the IBD, as well as the individual patient's needs and preferences.
